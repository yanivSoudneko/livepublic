In particular we loved having a wood burning stove and a really well equipped kitchen! We hiked in the surrounding forests, and stopped by in Karlstejn to visit the castle. We stayed just as a couple, but the house would easily accommodate more people. It was the best trip we've taken in ages and we hope to go back. Dog owners might want to be aware that the property is not fenced, although it is very quiet and the road is far away with very little traffic, for us (and our rather silly large dog) it wasn't a problem.",

Prior to booking I asked the host if they've done anything to improve the cleanliness but I didn't really get a reassuring response. I booked anyhow and I can see why others have complained about the cleanliness. Aside from this issue though, the apartment is really a fantastic location and the two balconies are awesome. It is also well furnished and trendy. If you require any special requests like a late check-out, be sure to confirm with the host after booking. I had explained that I could only book if we could check-out after the Sabbath and he said yes, for an additional 600 nis. I was perfectly fine with this so I went ahead and booked. Then, the morning of our check-in I found out that since I didn't confirm after-the-fact, the host let someone else book on Saturday. Fortunately, he made other accommodations for us and helped us move to a different apartment in the same building so that we could still stay until the Sabbath ended. It was annoying but we did appreciate that he made other plans for us and didn't charge us the 600 nis for a lake check-out. Overall, we had a very positive experience and I'd recommend the place to others.",
